1. Pick two countries and compare and contrast their heights. **Note:** The heights of these two countries are already averaged.
2. What are the average heights every year? (you'll need to do filtering to solve this)
3. How spread out are the heights between countries?
4. What is the distribution of countries heights over time?  Does the spread grow larger as you move forward in the arrow of time?  Or smaller? (use the center and spread to talk about this)
